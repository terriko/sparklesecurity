# sparklesecurity
Sparkling training missions for web security.

These are being created as a part of the ChickTech Code For Good Hackathon.
The idea being to teach more about security by providing tutorials, since
it is an essential part of software development.

## Resources

These training missions make use of some well-known vulnerable web
applications. They have other tutorials attached, but they didn't have
enough sparkles.
